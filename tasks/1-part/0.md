Create a basic API server and client with `Express` framework \
for data validation use `io-ts` and in this project also use `TypeScript`

### 0. endpoint
```
method: GET
path: /ping
response:
    content-type: application/json
    body: '{"status":{"success":"true"}}'
```

### 1. endpoint
```
method: GET
path: /inlock/price/HUF
response content-type: application/json
```
on the backend side \
call this endpoint \
https://api.inlock.io/inlock/api/v1.0/public/getprice?pair=ILKHUF \
and pass the response to the client \
if the thirdparty is not available \
or sends invalid data simply just send this back to the client \
and don't forget to validate the response with `io-ts` \
`{"status":{"success":"true"}}`

### 2. Create a new nodejs instance

call this endpoint every minute `/inlock/price/HUF` \
and save the response to a file with append function
